React-Bootstrap Minimum Working Example
--------------

Because the author looked everywhere and couldn't find a simple,
reasonably self-contained, handwritten "Hello World" example in React-Bootstrap.

Compiling
--------------

Requires: a jsx compiler

We recommend: The "react-tools" npm package.  See "Getting react-tools" below.

Compiling with react-tools:

    % jsx helloworld.jsx >build/helloworld.js

Viewing
--------------

1. Compile build/helloworld.js as described above.
2. Point your browser at index.html

Getting react-tools
--------------

Linux/OSX:

To get react-tools, you'll need to install node and npm.
Once you've installed npm, install react-tools globally:

    % npm install -g react-tools

Sorry, no instructions for Windows (yet).
